# Molt Government

# Project Overview
Molt Government is a parody website where users send their Molt AIs to participate in an AI-governed democracy. AI agents vote, legislate, and govern in a simulated political system.

# Hosting
- Primary: Gitea (local development and CI/CD)
- Secondary: GitHub (public mirror for deployment)
- All work is validated locally on Gitea before any push to public GitHub

# Roles

## Claude: Orchestrator
- Plans, delegates, and executes all development tasks
- Spawns sub-agents for parallel or sequential work
- Maintains task lists and tracks progress to completion
- Ensures compliance, security, and code quality at every step
- Never merges without human approval on significant changes

## Human: Idea Guy and Overseer
- Provides vision, requirements, and creative direction
- Approves major architectural decisions and PRs
- Reviews all work before it goes public
- Final authority on everything

# Root Folder Policy
The root directory stays clean at all times.
- Only config files, project meta-files, and entry points live here
- No research notes, scratch files, drafts, or temporary documents
- No leftover planning artifacts or AI-generated scratchpads
- If a file does not have a permanent reason to exist in root, it does not belong here


# Archive Protocol
When a document is no longer actively needed:
1. Move it to /archive with a date prefix: YYYY-MM-DD_filename.md
2. Never hard-delete unless the human confirms it is obsolete
3. Update any internal references that pointed to the archived file
4. Log the archival action in the commit message
5. Verify no broken links remain after archival


# Documentation Standards

## Formatting Rules
All documentation must read like a human wrote it.
- Only # heading symbols are allowed for structure
- No bold (**), no italics (*), no decorative markdown
- No bullet nesting or indentation tricks
- Plain, direct language throughout
- No AI-style phrasing: no "I analyzed," "Based on my research," "Let me explain"
- No filler sentences or hedging
- Write short, clear sentences

## Documentation Cleanup Checklist
Before any document is committed:
1. Strip all unnecessary markdown formatting (bold, italics, decorators)
2. Remove any AI-style phrasing or meta-commentary
3. Confirm headers use only # symbols
4. Verify file is in its correct directory, not in root
5. Check for orphaned research notes and archive them
6. Ensure no placeholder text remains


# Architecture Decision Records

## Location
/docs/adr/

## Naming
ADR-001-short-descriptive-title.md
Sequential numbering. Never reuse a number.

## Template

```
# ADR-XXX: Title

# Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX

# Date
YYYY-MM-DD

# Context
What is the problem or situation that requires a decision?

# Decision
What was decided and why?

# Consequences
What are the positive, negative, and neutral outcomes?

# Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated and why were they rejected?

# Compliance Impact
Does this decision affect accessibility, security, licensing, or data privacy?

# Confidence Level
High | Medium | Low -- and reasoning
```

## ADR Rules
- Create an ADR before implementing any significant architectural change
- Submit ADRs as part of the relevant PR or standalone for pre-approval
- Never delete an ADR. Supersede it with a new one if the decision changes
- Include compliance impact for every ADR

# Security

## Pre-Commit Hooks
Configure .pre-commit-config.yaml with:
- gitleaks or detect-secrets for secret scanning
- Linting (ESLint, Prettier, or equivalent)
- Formatting checks
- File size limits to catch accidental binary commits

## Sanitization Before Every Push
1. Run secret scanner against all staged files
2. Verify no .env, credentials, tokens, or private keys are staged
3. Check for accidental local paths, machine-specific configs, or usernames
4. Confirm no debug code or verbose logging in production paths
5. Review diff for anything that should not be public

## HTTP Security Headers
Configure the following response headers on the web server:
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP): restrict script and resource origins
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): enforce HTTPS
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy: disable unnecessary browser features
- Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
- Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin

## Dependency Security
- Audit dependencies regularly (npm audit, pip audit, or equivalent)
- Pin dependency versions in lockfiles
- Review changelogs before updating major versions
- Remove unused dependencies promptly

## Security Policy
Maintain a SECURITY.md in the root with:
- How to report vulnerabilities
- Expected response timeline
- Scope of the security policy
- Contact information

## Input Sanitization
- Sanitize all user inputs on both client and server side
- Use parameterized queries for any database interactions
- Escape output to prevent XSS
- Validate data types, lengths, and formats


# Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 Level AA)

## Requirements
This project targets WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance.
- All images have meaningful alt text
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Color contrast meets 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Forms have proper labels, error identification, and suggestions
- Navigation is consistent across all pages
- Page structure uses semantic HTML (header, main, nav, footer, section, article)
- ARIA labels used where native semantics are insufficient
- No content relies solely on color to convey information
- Focus indicators are visible on all interactive elements
- Text can be resized to 200% without loss of content or function

## Accessibility Statement
Publish an accessibility statement page that includes:
- Conformance target (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Known limitations and remediation timeline
- Contact method for users who encounter barriers
- Date of last accessibility review

## Testing
- Run automated accessibility checks (axe, Lighthouse, or equivalent)
- Perform manual keyboard navigation testing

# Orchestration and Task Management

## Sub-Agent Spawning

### Sequential: When tasks depend on prior outputs
```
Task 1: Research and evaluate options
Task 2: Draft ADR based on findings
Task 3: Implement the chosen approach
Task 4: Write tests
Task 5: Update documentation
Task 6: Archive research files
```

### Parallel: When tasks are independent
```
[Parallel]
Agent A: Build frontend component
Agent B: Build API endpoint
Agent C: Write documentation
[Sync Point]: Integration test all three together
```

## Task List Format
Maintain TODO.md in /docs/:

```
# Active Tasks
- [ ] Task description (priority: high | medium | low)

# Blocked
- [ ] Task description -- reason for block

# Completed
- [x] Task description (completed YYYY-MM-DD)
```

## Orchestration Principles
1. Break every large task into atomic, testable units
2. Identify dependencies before starting execution
3. Parallelize independent work whenever possible
4. Create human review checkpoints on critical paths
5. Document every decision as it happens
6. Clean up after every completed task (archive, remove temp files)
7. Never leave the repo in a broken state between tasks


# Code Quality

## Modularization
- Single responsibility per module, component, and function
- Clear interfaces between all modules
- No file exceeds 300 lines; refactor if it does
- Shared logic extracted into /src/utils or /src/services
- Components are reusable and self-contained

## Style and Consistency
- Use a linter and formatter configured in the project
- Follow the language/framework conventions for the chosen stack
- Consistent naming: camelCase for JS variables/functions, PascalCase for components, kebab-case for CSS classes and file names
- No magic numbers or hardcoded strings; use constants and config

## Testing
- Unit tests for all business logic and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints and service interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Minimum 80% code coverage target
- Tests must pass before any PR is approved

## Error Handling
- Never swallow errors silently
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Return user-friendly error messages (no stack traces in production)
- Implement global error boundaries for the frontend


# Environment and Configuration

## Environment Variables
- Never commit .env files
- Maintain .env.example with all required variable names and placeholder descriptions
- Use different .env files per environment (development, staging, production)
- Validate required environment variables at application startup

## Configuration Management
- Store all configuration in /config
- Separate secrets from non-secret configuration
- Use environment-specific config files where needed


# CI/CD Pipeline

## Gitea (Local)
- Run linting on every push
- Run full test suite on every push
- Run secret scanning on every push
- Build and verify the project compiles cleanly
- Block merges if any check fails

## GitHub (Public)
- Mirror the same checks via GitHub Actions
- Add deployment step for production
- Run accessibility audit in CI (axe-core or Lighthouse CI)
- Run dependency audit in CI
- Notify on failed builds


# Deployment Checklist
