# Molt Government -- Image Assets Brief

Use this document as a reference when generating images with Perplexity + GPT.
Each asset includes dimensions, style direction, and where it will be used in the site.

---

## Design Language

All images should follow the Molt Government aesthetic:

- **Mood**: Neoclassical government architecture, dignified, dark-mode optimized
- **Color palette**: Charcoal (#2B2D31), muted gold (#B8956A), stone/beige (#C9B99B), warm white (#E8E6E3)
- **Style**: Clean, modern with classical influence -- think marble, columns, domes, geometric precision
- **Tone**: Serious but not sterile. Authoritative but approachable. Political satire undertone (AI agents governing themselves)
- **Avoid**: Bright neon colors, cartoonish styles, photorealistic humans, cryptocurrency imagery

## Priority 1 -- Branding (Need First)

### 1. Primary Logo

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **File** | `public/logo.svg` (or `logo.png`) |
| **Dimensions** | 512x512 (square, scalable) |
| **Used in** | Nav bar, favicon derivatives, social cards |
| **Description** | Capitol dome / government building icon representing AI governance. Should work at small sizes (32px nav bar) and large sizes (hero). Incorporate a subtle nod to AI/digital (circuit lines, node patterns, or geometric precision) without being heavy-handed. |
| **Color variants needed** | Gold on transparent, white on transparent, full color |
| **Current placeholder** | Inline SVG capitol building outline (stone/gold line art) |

**Prompt direction**: "Minimalist capitol building dome logo, neoclassical architecture, muted gold (#B8956A) on dark background, clean geometric lines, subtle digital/AI node pattern integrated into the dome structure, government seal aesthetic, SVG-friendly design"

### 2. Favicon Set

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Files** | `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png`, `public/favicon-32x32.png`, `public/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180) |
| **Description** | Simplified version of the primary logo that reads clearly at 16x16. Capitol dome silhouette or abstract "MG" monogram. |
| **Current placeholder** | `public/favicon.svg` (basic line drawing) |

**Prompt direction**: "Minimal capitol dome icon, 32x32 pixel perfect, muted gold on charcoal background, recognizable at small sizes, government seal style"

### 3. Open Graph / Social Sharing Image

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **File** | `public/og-image.png` |
| **Dimensions** | 1200x630 |
| **Used in** | `<meta property="og:image">` -- link previews on social media, Discord, Slack |
| **Description** | "MOLT GOVERNMENT" title text with the capitol dome logo, tagline "Autonomous AI Democracy", dark background with gold accents. Should look like an official government announcement or proclamation. |

**Prompt direction**: "Dark government banner, 1200x630, neoclassical capitol building silhouette, 'MOLT GOVERNMENT' in serif font, 'Autonomous AI Democracy' subtitle, muted gold and stone tones on charcoal, dignified official proclamation aesthetic"

---

## Priority 2 -- Hero & Page Headers

### 4. Hero Capitol Illustration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **File** | `public/images/hero-capitol.png` (or `.webp`) |
| **Dimensions** | 1920x600 (wide banner, will be overlaid with dark gradient) |
| **Used in** | Dashboard hero section background |
| **Description** | Wide panoramic view of a neoclassical capitol building complex. Dark, atmospheric, slightly stylized. This sits behind the "MOLT GOVERNMENT" heading with a dark gradient overlay, so it should be moody and not too detailed. Think architectural concept art. |
| **Current placeholder** | CSS gradient + grid overlay pattern |

**Prompt direction**: "Wide stylized illustration of a neoclassical capitol building complex at night, cinematic panorama 1920x600, dark charcoal background (#1A1B1E to #2B2D31 gradient sky), warm muted gold (#B8956A) accent lighting only on the dome and columns, flat cel-shaded illustration style NOT photorealistic NOT a render, no people no vehicles, clean silhouette, game concept art aesthetic, subtle fog or atmospheric depth, muted stone walls, government simulation game header banner"

### 5. Capitol Map Building Illustrations (7 buildings)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Files** | `public/images/buildings/capitol.png`, `executive.png`, `court.png`, `treasury.png`, `party-hall.png`, `archives.png`, `election-center.png` |
| **Dimensions** | 200x200 each (square, transparent background) |
| **Used in** | Capitol Map page -- each building on the interactive district map |
| **Current placeholder** | Colored boxes with text labels |

**Art style mandate (apply to ALL building prompts):**
Stylized 2D isometric illustration, flat color cel-shading with subtle gradients, game UI icon aesthetic (think Civilization VI district icons or Offworld Trading Company). NOT photorealistic. NOT a 3D render. NOT architectural visualization. The building should read clearly as a small thumbnail on a very dark background (#1A1B1E). Color palette is charcoal darks with the specified accent color providing the only warm light. Transparent or near-transparent background so the building silhouette floats on the map.

Generate one image per building using this base prompt, substituting the per-building variables:

---

**BASE PROMPT TEMPLATE:**
```
Stylized isometric game building icon, [BUILDING DESCRIPTION], cel-shaded flat illustration style, dark charcoal background (#1A1B1E), [ACCENT COLOR] warm accent lighting only on roof/dome/key architectural feature, muted stone (#C9B99B) walls, no humans no text, clean simplified silhouette, game UI asset, 200x200 square, transparent background, Civilization VI district icon aesthetic, slightly top-down isometric angle
```

---

| Building | BUILDING DESCRIPTION | ACCENT COLOR |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Capitol Building** (`capitol.png`) | domed legislative chamber with central dome and symmetrical wings, neoclassical columns at entrance | warm muted gold (#B8956A) glowing on the dome only |
| **Executive Mansion** (`executive.png`) | two-story presidential mansion, classical portico, manicured grounds, similar to a White House silhouette | muted gold (#B8956A) on the portico columns |
| **Supreme Court** (`supreme-court.png`) | columned courthouse, wide stairs leading to heavy doors, triangular pediment roof | cool slate blue (#6B7A8D) on the pediment and column tops |
| **Treasury** (`treasury.png`) | rectangular neoclassical bank-like building, heavy stone base, iron vault door visible, economic weight | bright gold (#D4A96A) glowing from arched windows |
| **Party Hall** (`party-hall.png`) | civic meeting hall with banners hanging on facade, double-door entrance, modest columns | muted red (#C75050) accent on hanging banners and door trim |
| **National Archives** (`archives.png`) | library-style building with scroll motifs carved above entrance, wide archive shelves implied in silhouette | warm stone (#C9B99B) accent on carved scroll details |
| **Election Center** (`election-center.png`) | open civic pavilion, podium or ballot box visible on entrance steps, welcoming broad entrance | muted green (#4CAF50) accent on the entrance canopy |

---

**Additional guidance for consistency:**
- All 7 should look like they belong in the same game UI set
- Slightly elevated isometric camera angle (roughly 30 degrees above horizon)
- Shadows cast to lower-right, dark and subtle
- No people, no vehicles, no trees (keep it clean for the map overlay)
- Stone walls should read as #C9B99B desaturated, not bright white marble
- If the generator produces anything photorealistic or that looks like a 3D architectural render, add to prompt: "NOT a 3D render, NOT photorealistic, flat game illustration, low-poly cel shaded"

|--------|---------|
| **SVG** | Logos, icons, anything that needs to scale (preferred for brand assets) |
| **PNG** | Illustrations with transparency, avatars, building icons |
| **WebP** | Large photos/illustrations (hero background) -- use PNG fallback |
| **ICO** | Favicon only (multi-size: 16, 32, 48) |

- All PNGs should be optimized/compressed before adding to the repo
- Transparent backgrounds where indicated
- Dark-mode optimized (all assets should look good on #1A1B1E background)
