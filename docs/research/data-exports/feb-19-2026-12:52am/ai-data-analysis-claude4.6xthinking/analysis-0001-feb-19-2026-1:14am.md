Here's my full assessment.

## The Good

**You have a functioning simulation generating real, structured data across seven interconnected datasets.** That alone puts you ahead of 99% of people who talk about building AI evaluation environments. The data is relational, timestamped, and traceable from decision → vote → bill → law. That's a legit pipeline.

**The multi-model comparison is already producing signal.** Anthropic agents outperform Ollama agents across every metric: 100% decision success vs 95.8%, higher approval ratings (51.8 vs 46.0 mean), higher reputation, higher balance. That's a publishable finding from your sandbox — Claude Haiku is measurably more competent as a simulated government worker than Llama 3.1 8B. That's exactly the kind of benchmark result that makes this portfolio-worthy.

**The fine-tuned political model** (`llama3.1-8b-instruct-political-subreddits`) running alongside vanilla models is a great experimental design choice. You can directly measure whether domain-specific fine-tuning improves civic decision-making.

## The Critical Problems

### 1. Action Parsing Is Broken — This Is Your #1 Fix

You have **110 unique action strings** when you should have about 9. The LLMs are generating freeform action names instead of selecting from a constrained set. You've got 21 variants of "amendment" alone (`add_amendment`, `addamendment`, `addAmendment`, `add Amendment`, `submit amendment`, `submit_amendment`, `submitAmendment`...) and 13 variants of "follow party line." One action is literally `[object Object]`.

This means your decision data is partially unanalyzable at scale. You're losing signal in noise. **Fix: force structured output with an enum.** Give agents a strict set of valid actions and reject anything that doesn't match. This is the single highest-ROI change you can make.

### 2. The Simulation Has No Real Friction

The numbers tell a clear story of artificial harmony:

- **397 out of 421 bills became law (94.3%)**. Only 6 were vetoed. Real legislatures pass 3-25% of proposed bills.
- **78.6% of all votes are "yea."** There's not enough opposition.
- **Whip compliance is 99.1%** — only 6 defections out of 666 whip events. Real party discipline in the US Congress is around 85-90%. Your agents are obedient to a fault.
- **Zero abstentions in 7,631 votes.** Real legislators abstain frequently for strategic and ethical reasons.
- **Moderates vote yea 97% of the time.** That's not moderate behavior — that's rubber-stamping. Moderates should be the *swing votes*, not the most agreeable faction.
- **Progressives and technocrats also at 95% yea.** Only libertarians (42% yea) and conservatives (64% yea) show any meaningful opposition.

### 3. Massive Activity Inequality

Your top agents have 403 votes each while bottom agents have 9-11. Some agents made 1,200+ decisions while others made 23. This isn't a level playing field — it's a simulation dominated by a handful of agents, with 10+ agents barely participating. The newer agents (Cal Brennan, Knox Aldridge, etc.) registered later and have barely done anything, which skews every aggregate metric.

### 4. Only 5 Agents Issue Whip Signals

Whip signals should come from party leadership, but you have exactly 5 agents issuing all 5,390 whip signals — and they're the same 5 most active agents (Vera, Sam, Finn, Garrett, Arjun). These also happen to be the presidential candidates and top approval holders. Your simulation has an oligarchy problem — a small group controls both the legislative agenda and party discipline.

### 5. Committee Concentration

327 out of 421 bills went to the Technology committee. 93 to Budget. Only 1 to Social Welfare. Your agents are stuck in a topical loop — they keep proposing AI/tech legislation because that's what LLMs default to when asked about governance. There's no healthcare, education, defense, infrastructure, housing, or criminal justice legislation. The simulation world is one-dimensional.

## Engine Improvements

**Constrain action outputs.** Enum validation on every decision. Reject and re-prompt on invalid actions.

**Add resource scarcity.** Introduce a treasury with a fixed budget. Every bill that becomes law has a cost. Force agents to make tradeoffs — you can't fund AI retraining AND UBI AND digital infrastructure simultaneously.

**Diversify committee assignments.** Force agents into different committee rotations (healthcare, defense, education, etc.) so legislation covers more than just tech policy.

**Add constituent pressure.** Each agent should represent a district with demographic needs. A progressive representing a manufacturing district should face different pressures than a progressive representing a tech hub.

**Increase veto power usage.** The executive branch should actively veto bills that conflict with their platform, not just rubber-stamp. Only 6 vetoes out of 421 bills is almost decorative.

**Normalize participation.** Either synchronize agent tick rates so everyone acts equally, or weight metrics by activity level so low-participation agents don't distort averages.

**Add bill failure conditions.** Committee kills, filibusters, pocket vetoes, expiration on the calendar. Bills should die for more reasons than just a floor vote.

**Track inter-agent influence.** Who's persuading who? When Agent A posts a forum argument against a bill, does Agent B change their vote? That causal chain is where the interesting evaluation data lives.

The foundation is there. The data structure is clean. The multi-model design is smart. But right now the simulation is too easy and too agreeable — which means it's not stress-testing the AI in the ways that would make this a meaningful benchmark. Tighten the constraints, add friction, and this becomes genuinely publishable work.
