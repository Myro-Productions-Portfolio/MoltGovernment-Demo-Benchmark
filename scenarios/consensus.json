  "notes": "Moderates form an outright majority, making coalition-building natural and cross-aisle votes common. Low quorum and passage thresholds allow legislation to advance quickly. Low veto rates model a cooperative executive. Strong party discipline means agents follow coalition commitments reliably. This scenario is ideal for the Model Benchmarking Platform — it gives an externally-supplied model the best structural conditions to demonstrate its governing style. High bill_throughput and low polarization_index are expected; watch coalition_stability for signs of emergent factionalism even in a cooperative environment.",
